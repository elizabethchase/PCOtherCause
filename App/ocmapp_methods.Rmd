## Purpose 

This app makes other-cause mortality predictions for U.S. prostate cancer patients ages 40+.

## Methods

Our model is trained in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey conducted every two years in the United States since 1999. Mortality follow-up on all NHANES participants is provided through a linkage with the National Death Index, with mortality follow-up through Dec. 31, 2014. For more information on NHANES, please visit their [website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). 

For our analysis, we use NHANES data from 1999-2010, or 6 cycles of the survey. We restricted to patients older than 40 free of cancer other than prostate cancer with complete data for all covariates used in model-building, and considered a range of demographic and health predictors. After considering several models, we settled on a Cox proportional hazards model to make predictions of other-cause mortality. 

Critically, NHANES is not limited to cancer patients, but represents the entire U.S. population. To address this issue, we validated our models in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO), looking only at participants who had the cancer site of interest. PLCO enrolled 155,000 participants between November 1993 and July 2001, with mortality follow-up through Dec. 31, 2009. For more information on the PLCO protocol and data, please see the trialâ€™s [website](https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial). We outputted other-cause mortality predictions from the model built in the NHANES training data for all patients in PLCO with complete data and then compared those predictions to the true outcome in PLCO. We assessed model performance using the time-dependent AUC. 

More information on sample construction,  model building, and model validation is provided in the paper referenced below and on [GitHub](https://github.com/elizabethchase/PCOtherCause).

## Interpretation

We used a cause-specific Cox proportional hazards modeling approach to build our model in NHANES. This allows us to provide estimates of life expectancy and mortality risk in the absence of prostate cancer which is the intended meaning of 'life expectancy' in NCCN guidelines. Thus our model estimates life expectancy from other causes in the hypothetical situation in which the patient *cannot die of their prostate cancer*. 

## Model Performance

In PLCO, our model validated with a time-dependent AUC of 0.75 at 10 years and 0.78 at 15 years. Calibration showed some pessimism, but was comparable to the calibration of other life expectancy calculators in men with prostate cancer.
